This application is a stripped-down version of a microservice responsible for user management in a multitenancy environment. 
The layered architecture structure of DDD has been skipped and some simplification has been made. 
Keycloak is used for authentication and authorization, as documented in the Keycloak documentation: https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/

The main purpose of this sample code is to demonstrate how to manage users between two systems in a cohesive manner. This project communicates with an external system by transforming and adjusting data to work both ways. The external service is a source of data for users, but this microservice has the full power to update, add, and modify data in the external service.

The project also synchronizes data by a background job based on cron time or user firing command. Users' data is stored in a local Keycloak instance and by updating the credential table in a PostgreSQL database via synchronization methods, users can log into the system even when the external service is unavailable.

Overall, this code provides a useful example for integrating user management across multiple systems. However, it is highly dependent on data specific to our system and any use of this code will likely require customization to fit your specific needs.
